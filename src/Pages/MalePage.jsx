        <h2>About us</h2>

        <p>
          We’re a team of four passionate dreamers, developers, and creatives
          who believe in building real connections in a digital world. Our
          journey started with a simple idea — to create a space where people
          feel seen, valued, and loved. Each of us brings something unique to
          the table: code that works like magic, designs that spark joy, words
          that speak to the heart, and ideas that keep love at the center of
          everything we do. We're not just building another dating app. We're
          planting the seeds of something meaningful — a garden where love grows
          naturally, gently, and beautifully. Let’s rewrite the love story,
          together❤️.
